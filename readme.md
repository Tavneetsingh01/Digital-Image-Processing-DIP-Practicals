# Digital Image Processing (DIP) Practicals using Python :snake:
***
This repository contains the following listed DIP practicals that are done using various python libraries.

- How to read an image in python (using cv2 module, as numpy array 
and skimage module)
  - a) Using CV2 library
  - b) Using Input from command-line argument
  - c) Using Skimage Library
- How to resize an image.
- How to load multiple images.
- How to extract different color channels from an image.
- How to convert an image from rgb to gray.
- How to convert an image from greyscale to binary image.
- How to upsample an image.
- How to downsample an image.
- Write the program to generate the negative of image.
- Write a program to increase the contrast of the image using 
contrast Stretching.
- Write a program to increase the contrast of the image using 
thresholding.
- Write a python code to enhance an image using Gray level slicing
(with and without background).
  - a) With background.
  - b) Without background.
- Write a python code to improve the dynamic range of an input 
image using Log transformation or power law transformation.

> #### ![This is the practical file](Digital%20Image%20Processing%20Practicals%20By%20Tavneet%20Singh.docx) which contains all the above listed programs in one file, you can use this file and make it your own practical file by making some minor edits in the file.

>  :handshake: Feel free to generate a pull request to this repository to contribute more programs regarding Image processing even done using other tools and languages like Matlab, etc.
