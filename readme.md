This repository contains the following listed DIP practicals that are done using various python libraries.

- How to read an image in python (using cv2 module, as numpy array 
and skimage module)
  - a) Using CV2 library
  - b) Using Input from command-line argument
  - c) Using Skimage Library
- How to resize an image.
- How to load multiple images.
- How to extract different color channels from an image.
- How to convert an image from rgb to gray.
- How to convert an image from greyscale to binary image.
- How to upsample an image.
